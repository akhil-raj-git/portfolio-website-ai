**1. Introduction**

The goal of this project is to design an AI-powered chatbot for a personal portfolio website. The chatbot will leverage the Llama 2 generative AI model to produce intuitive and intelligent responses to user queries. At this phase of the project, there will be no user interface (UI) development and all responses will be outputted to the terminal.

**2. System Overview**

The system will comprise mainly two components: the User Input Processor and the Response Generator.

- **User Input Processor**: This module will handle the user's queries. It takes the user's input, processes it and sends it to the Response Generator.

- **Response Generator**: This module interfaces with the LLama 2 AI model to generate the chatbot's responses. It takes the processed input from the User Input Processor, communicates with the AI model, and formats the generated response for output.

**3. Data Model**

Given the requirements and the current stage of the project, only a minimum data model is needed. Conversation data will be temporarily stored in a Python list object while the application is running. Each item in the list will represent a turn in the conversation and will be a dictionary with two keys: 'user' for user input and 'bot' for the chatbot's response.

**4. Technology Stack**

- Programming Language: Python
- AI Model: Llama 2 generative AI model

**5. Detailed Design**

**5.1 User Input Processor**

The User Input Processor will consist of a simple function that reads user input from the terminal using Python's built-in `input()` function. It will then perform necessary preprocessing before sending the input to the Response Generator.

**5.2 Response Generator**

The Response Generator will be responsible for interfacing with the LLama 2 AI model. It will receive the user input from the User Input Processor, generate a response using the AI model, and return the response.

**5.3 Conversation Data Structure**

As mentioned earlier, the conversation will be stored in a list. The structure of an individual turn will look like this:

```python
{
    "user": "User's input",
    "bot": "Bot's response"
}
```

**6. Testing Plan**

Initial testing will involve running the chatbot in the terminal and trying various inputs to test the AI model's ability to generate appropriate responses. Further testing will involve ensuring the chatbot can handle various error scenarios gracefully.

**7. Conclusion**

This Technical Design Document outlines the design of a simple, terminal-based AI chatbot for a personal portfolio website. The chatbot leverages the LLama 2 generative AI model to produce intelligent responses to user queries. While the data model is minimal at this stage, it will serve the purpose of the project effectively. As the project progresses, additional functionalities may be considered for implementation.

**8. Future Improvements**

Potential future improvements include adding a frontend interface, storing conversation history persistently, and expanding the chatbot's capabilities by integrating with other APIs or services.
